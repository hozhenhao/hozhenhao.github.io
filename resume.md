``` Neural Nets|Image Segmentation|Image Classification|Tree-Based Algorithms|Regression ```  

### INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
**Title** - Federated Simulation of Medical Image Segmentation - Sponsor Redacted <span style="float: right; ">Jun 2022 - Dec 2022</span>  

- Simulated federated image segmentation using distributed computing tools and data partitioning to prove the viability of Federated Machine Learning with data residing in different geographic regions.
- The image segmenation is implemented with patch-based and boundary refinement methods in order to handle large medical images.
- The simulation is implemented with lazy-loading of data to optimize ram and memory usage as well as patching to retain all the image spatial information. 

### PERSONAL PROJECTS
