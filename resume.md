### MACHINE LEARNING SKILLS
``` Neural Nets | Image Segmentation | Image Classification | Tree-Based Algorithms | Regression ```  

### INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
**Title** - Federated Simulation of Retinal Image Segmentation - Sponsor Redacted <span style="float: right; ">Jun 2022 - Dec 2022</span>  

- Simulated federated image segmentation using distributed computing tools and data partitioning to prove the viability of Federated Machine Learning with data residing in different geographic regions.
- The image segmenation is implemented with patch-based and boundary refinement methods in order to handle large medical images.
- The simulation is implemented with lazy-loading of data to optimize ram and memory usage as well as patching to retain all the image spatial information. 

### PERSONAL PROJECTS
**Title** - Dirt Detection CV App using FastAPI and Streamlit - Deep Skilling Bootcamp <span style="float: right; ">Jun 2022 - Jun 2022</span>  

- Final Presentation Project in an 2 months AI/ML bootcamp.
- This final project is implemented within 4 days.
- Implemented the DirtNet paper with YOLOv3 model and expose the model through FastAPI and Streamlit.
